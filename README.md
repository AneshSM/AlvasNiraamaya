# AlvasNiraamaya
Major Project:


AlvasNiraamaya is a React Native mobile application for an ayurvedic hospital. It is designed to help patients book appointments, receive reminders, and access information about the hospital and its services.

## Installation

Before running the app, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. You also need to have the Expo CLI installed globally. If you don't have them installed, you can follow the instructions on the Node.js and Expo websites to download and install them.

To install the app, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/AneshSM/AlvasNiraamaya.git

cd AlvasNiraamaya

npm install

```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the app:

```bash

npm start

```

This will start the Expo development server, which you can use to run the app on an iOS or Android emulator or a physical device.

## Usage

When you run `npm start`, the Expo development server will open in your default web browser. From there, you can select how you want to run the app, either on an emulator or a physical device.

If you want to run the app on a physical device, you need to install the Expo app on the device and scan the QR code displayed in the Expo development server.

Once the app is running, you can use it to book appointments, receive reminders, and access information about the hospital and its services.

## Folder Structure

- `assets`: Contains the images and other assets used by the app.
